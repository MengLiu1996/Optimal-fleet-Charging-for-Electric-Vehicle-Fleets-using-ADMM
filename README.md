# Optimal-fleet-Charging-for-Electric-Vehicle-Fleets-using-ADMM

## Introduction:

The code is built using an ADMM optimal charging framework to solve a cost minimization problem for a fleet of electric vehicles considering 
both energy and battery degradation costs.


## Code:

The main file is named pricedbased100 that has the major ADMM framework that is implemented for a fleet of 40 EVs.
The other files which are named cosntraint1, constraint2 and constraint3 represent the constraint on the charger power level, the energy requirement based 
on minimal or greedy charging and battery perational dynamics respectively.

There is also a file named profile that is basically, to show variable charger allocation that been done in the code. 

## Running:

The code can directky be run by using the main file and then changin the functions as needed for the user.
